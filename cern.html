                    <div>The CERN Beamline for Schools (BL4S) competition offers high school students worldwide the chance to propose and conduct their own physics experiments using a CERN particle beam. CERN is the world's largest particle accelerator, where some of the most important scientific discoveries of this century have been made. In BL4S, teams submit a written proposal and video describing their experiment, with finalists receiving expert guidance to refine their ideas. Winners are invited to CERN or another particle physics facility to execute their experiment, gaining hands-on experience with cutting-edge research tools and techniques. The competition provides a unique opportunity to explore particle physics, collaborate with scientists, and inspire future careers in STEM.</div>

                        <div>For our BL4S proposal as Runnymede's 2024 team HeiCERNberg, we investigated two types of high-energy X-rays: synchrotron radiation, created when fast-moving particles bend in a magnetic field, and Bremsstrahlung, produced when particles are suddenly slowed down as they interact with the nuclei of heavy atoms (that is, atoms with a lot of protons and neutrons). Using an X-ray camera we built and designed ourselves, we tested how these X-rays could create images by shining them through metal samples of different thicknesses and composition. Our goal was to see which type of X-ray worked better for atomic imaging (what is called spectroscopy) and why, while also evaluating how well our camera performed. We even got the opportunity to discuss our ideas and methods with some of the top physicists in Spain. Although we didn't win the competition, we were honoured to receive a commendation given to only the top 10% of teams, which made all our hard work and creativity truly rewarding!</div>
